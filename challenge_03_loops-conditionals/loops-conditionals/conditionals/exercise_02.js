/* What's happening here is that the 'age' variable fits the condition of the second conditional branch of being 
equal OR larger than 3 (in this case 20 is larger than 3), so the program forgoes checking the remaining conditionals. 

One way to fix this would be to make program compare the variable within a range of values, instead of individual ones. 
To do that we simply append a logical AND conditonal to each branch that makes sure the variable stays within the desired 
value range. Otherwise, the program jumps to the next branch.
